This mod requires Harmony.

# Overview
In RimWorld, every skill gains experience when it is practiced. Every skill, except social when trading (and stonecutting but that mod exists already).

If you ever felt like your trade negotiator should have really learned a thing or two after settling a deal worth 10000+ silver, this mod does just that with plenty of settings to satisfy your preferences.

When buying goods, experience gain is (by default) based on the standard market value of that good. Buying a single plasteel always nets you 9 experience regardless of how much it actually costs, multiplied by the colonist's passion and global learning factor.

When selling goods, experience gain is based on the negotiated value of that good. A single gold bar sold for 8 silver nets you 8 experience, multiplied by learning factor. As social skill improves, better deals are negotiated by the colonist, resulting in more experience at the later levels.

Royalty tributes do not give experience, as there is no bonus to having social (even though it uses your Inspired Trade).


# Save Compatability
This mod is safe to add and remove at anytime. The mod only calculates experience gain at the moment of trade confirmation. No additional items nor mechanics are added.

# Mod Compatability
It works fine in my 300 mod playthrough. The only thing I can imagine that would be incompatible with this mod is something that messes with the cart system when trading.

# CE?
Sure.
